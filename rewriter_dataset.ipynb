I had to use a razor blade to shave excess material that rest on top of the buffer tube. It was an easy fix but shouldn't be required by the customer. 2nd complaint is the battery storage caps. They poorly screw in and could easily be lost, not too mention their hard to put back in. They should come tethered to the saddle instead i had to jerry rig some paracord to prevent loss. Im still happy with the purchase but wish their was better quality in this product.\",\n",

Also, it's a bit thicker than I'd like. Aside from that it's not terrible, with a nice rubbery texture and decent grip surface. The buttons are all functional and you don't have to press hard to get them t function. It also isn't a bad looking case, but you get what you pay for. I'll be trying a different case out, personally.\",\n",
       "  \"The AmazonBasics calculator is decent but not something I'm over the moon about. It works fine and does the job well, but the product doesn't strike me as high quality. When I received it, one of the feet was missing and there were scuffs marring the screen (not the kind I can remove either). I was rather surprised about the defects seeing that it was in bubble wrap snuggly tucked inside a box inside the mailer. The paint, while attractive enough, looks as though it'll wear away in time and the calculator is made from very light plastic. It's not all bad though, the buttons are nicely sized and I like that there are different colors for the separate functions. The 'clear entry' button being so far from the 'clear all' one makes for less mistakes on my part, and that I love, seeing as most calculators feature them right next to each other. Even though it's dual-powered and will shut off within five to seven minutes, there is an 'off' button which is useful to those who like to conserve wherever possible. I don't quite like where the 'equals' button is as it's rather awkward to use, but that's a nitpick. Surprisingly, there is a one-year warranty and the price seems fair for this type of calculator. If all you need is a basic calculator for your desk, in the kitchen, or wherever, this'll do.\",\n",

I was afraid to put anything that had any weight in it. I fixed this by cutting a piece of 3/4\" plywood the same dimensions as the box. I mounted the plywood to the trailer tongue, and mounted the box to the plywood. I\\'m also planning on getting some weather stripping for the lid to make sure no water gets in.

       " 0: ['EDIT: I\\'m leaving my original review below but have to note that I ended up returning this kit. The hi-hat pad went bad within two weeks of light use (I\\'m a adult just doing beginner level exercises on it 20 minutes a day at most). Although I originally praised the build quality, after very light wear other problems arose. The build quality here is actually quite horrible. There are drum kit game controllers for Rock Band that supersede this quality. I think Alesis should be ashamed of this product. I\\'ve written them about the Mac OS compatibility and they responded saying they could not reproduce the problem. The hi-hat going out was the last straw.\\n\\nAmazon has been very good about the return but boxing this thing up is a utter nightmare, it comes in a very very small box for it\\'s size. Do not waste your time or money on this kit unless you\\'re buying it for a five year old to learn on. It is not worthy of an adult. I would not buy this kit for my child either. I\\'ve communicated with others in the Alesis forums on the vendors website that are reporting quality problems with the DM6 and DM10 kits also. I\\'m not seeing this type of negative reports for Rolands products. You generally get what you pay for but in this case I believe we have a very high defect rate on an entire line of products that aren\\'t well built and a vendor who truly does not care. That has been my personal experience. I suggest going to the Alesis forums and doing some research for yourself there to decide if it\\'s worth the risk. With all the pain its caused me, I would say the DM Lite is one of the worst purchases I\\'ve made in the last ten years. If you intend to really use it as a musician for MIDI purposes, band rehearsal, etc.. please take my advise on look elsewhere for the sake of your music and your band I would avoid the Alesis branded e-drum products... My original review is below...\\n\\nAfter much debate I decided to give the DM Lite a try over the Roland TD4KP. My objective is to have a high quality, portable drum kit for home studio use that could also be taken to coffee houses. From all demos I knew the TD4KP was a better designed product in terms of sound quality and portability (it just folds up) however the DM Lite cost less than half of the TD4KP and I was only seeing positive reviews, so I gave it a shot.\\n\\nWith the Alesis DM Lite, Alesis has provided a picture of this unit nicely folded on the products home page as if to say \"me too\" but the comparisons really stop there. The DM Lite does not fold up in the same way. In fact there was no design effort put into this kit having a fold up feature as the Roland kit does (Roland hold a patent on this feature) so Alesis is sort for falsely marketing this. I say \"sort of\" because they never claim the kit folds up they just show pictures of what it looks like out of the box on their site. To get it back to that state from being playable takes about 20 minutes. The sound module on the Roland unit is vastly superior to what Alesis delivers. Allow me to state the problems: First the quality of the kits themselves. The snare and toms sound ok. The kick is way too loud and regardless what speaker you put it through it distorts. The high hat and crash on the most natural sounding kit in the module is immediately recognizable to novice ears as fake. The samples are overall weak. The sound modules built in trainer and other beginner features combined with the quality of the kits mark this as a beginners product and that\\'s unfortunate because the Roland kit I assumed it was a counterpart to is pro grade in every possible way. Designed to be portable for beginners intermediate and pros. That being said this kit is hard to beat at the price point for a beginner. Alesis sound module may not be up to Roland (it also cost half the price of the Roland kit), but it beats Simmons and D-Drums products in this price range. If you run the kit into a good PA with decent EQ options and add a reverb or digital delay between the kit and PA you can make the internal sounds workable for a live setting. As much as I love the MIDI option here, you do notice the kits built into the module are a bit more responsive than what I\\'ve been able to do with MIDI (that may be my software I\\'ve just tried EZ Drummer and GarageBand 11\\'s built in drum kit software instruments).\\n\\nThe overall build quality of the pads and the content delivered here is a good. Not fantastic, but impressive for the price. The foot pedals seem cheap and should have better grips on the bottom but mine are still working so no gripes.\\n\\nSince I despise the sound quality of the included module I knew as I was unboxing that I would not be using the built in tones. I knew from the youtube samples I listened to of this kit vs the mentioned Roland. They are just night and day different, but fortunately this module as MIDI out. So a big part of the missing two stars from my review of this otherwise almost outstanding little budget kit is the MIDI feature. Connect this thing to Mac OS X Mountain Lion and Garage Band 11 and select the Rock Kit, apply the Room reverb and select the Drum Punchy compression option and you\\'re in rock drum heaven with this thing. Play around with some of Garage Band\\'s other kits and combine the EQ and reverb options and you have a pro sounding synth on your hands with a very responsive DM Lite kit! Yea! Well, almost Yea.... This is why I bought it, however this is not working flawless. Here are the issues I\\'m having:\\n\\n1.) The drum module is not compatible with Mac OS X Mavericks. Doesn\\'t work with Logic Pro X, Garage Band 11 or X or Ableton Live. It\\'s just incompatible with the latest Mac OS X as Alesis has no ETA on the fix... I\\'m very unhappy about that. Alesis support is working with me to try and solve this. They have told me that the product has no known issues with Mavericks and that they can\\'t reproduce in their lab.\\n\\n2.) Works great on Mac OS X Mountain Lion and Garage Band 11 when you try to record/track though MIDI. The module locked up on my a few times (when using the MIDI out option) but hasn\\'t in a last few days. It sounds great and opens the door to great drum synths out there from Garage Band to EZ Drummer or whatever software based kit you\\'d like.\\n\\nI will provide an update on how well Alesis support helped me resolve the MIDI issue with OS X Mavericks.',\n",
